This HTML code creates an Online Voting System page with two sections: User Registration and User Login. Here's an explanation of each part:

1. Structure and Design
HTML Structure:

The page includes a container with two separate forms: one for user registration and one for user login.
Each form is enclosed in a .form-container div for consistent styling.
Styling:

The page uses Bootstrap for responsive design and styling. The form-control and btn classes make the inputs and buttons visually appealing.
Custom CSS styles add a light background (#f8f9fa) and styling for the form containers (shadow, border-radius, padding, etc.).
2. User Registration Form
HTML Fields:

Username: A text input field for the user's username.
Email: An email input field that requires a valid email format.
Password: A password field for the user to enter a password.
Confirm Password: A password field to confirm the password matches.
JavaScript Validation:

The registrationForm has an event listener for the submit event.
On form submission:
Prevents the default submission behavior using e.preventDefault().
Retrieves values from the form fields.
Checks if the password and confirm password match.
Alerts the user if the passwords do not match; otherwise, confirms successful registration.
3. User Login Form
HTML Fields:

Username: A text input field for the user's username.
Password: A password input field for the user's password.
JavaScript Validation:

The loginForm has an event listener for the submit event.
On form submission:
Prevents the default submission behavior.
Retrieves values from the username and password fields.
Placeholder logic (alert('Login successful!')) simulates login success. Actual logic would involve verifying credentials against a server or database.
4. Libraries and Dependencies
Bootstrap CSS & JS:

Bootstrap ensures responsive design and simplifies styling with prebuilt components (e.g., btn-primary, form-control, etc.).
Bootstrap's JavaScript components (like modals or tooltips) are included via the bootstrap.bundle.min.js.
Custom CSS:

The form containers are styled with a clean, minimalistic design for better usability.
Custom JavaScript:

Handles form submission, validates user input, and provides user feedback (alerts).
For registration, checks the matching passwords. For login, performs simple placeholder logic.
5. Key Features
Responsive Design: The form adjusts gracefully for different screen sizes due to Bootstrap's grid system.
Client-Side Validation: JavaScript ensures basic checks (password matching, required fields).
User Feedback: Alerts are shown for validation errors or success messages.
6. Potential Enhancements
Add backend integration to handle user data securely.
Improve password security with stronger validations and encryption.
Provide detailed error messages and form-level validation feedback.
Use modern UX patterns like toasts or inline validation instead of alert() for better user experience.
